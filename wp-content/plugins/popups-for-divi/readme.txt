A quick and easy way to create Popup layers inside the Divi Visual Builder!

== Description ==

No configuration needed. Simply activate the plugin and add the CSS class "popup" and ID tag to a divi section. To open the popup you only need to place a link on the page with the URL pointing to the section ID.

# ℹ️ How it works

1. Edit a section and set the **section ID** to "`newsletter-optin`" and the **section CSS class** to "`popup`"
2. Add a link (or button, etc) on the page and set the **link URL** to "`#newsletter-optin`"
3. **That's all**. Save the page! When a visitor clicks on your new link the popup will be opened.

# ⭐️ Additional details

* Examples
* CSS class options

# 🎂 Popups for Divi turns 2

Wow, it's already two years since the beginning of Popups for Divi!

It has been a great time and we've learned a lot. During that time we added a ton of features and have created a stable and powerful marketing plugin.

To celebrate the anniversary, we have created a six-day course that teaches you everything about the plugin. It walks you through the basics of creating your first Popup, shows possible ways to customize your Popup layouts and goes into advanced techniques and usages of the plugin.

> "The instruction emails really helped me to understand how to use the plugin correctly!"

The course is available in your **wp-admin Dashboard** right after you install and activate the plugin. Check out the screenshots to see the form. Also, have a look in the FAQ section, if you want to disable this feature.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `popups-for-divi` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much performance does Popups for Divi need? =

Actually none! We designed it with maximum page performance in mind. Our tests did show literally no change in page loading speed.

The plugin will add a single line of CSS to the page output and load two files that currently are only about 31 kb in size (9kb gzipped). Both files are cached by the browser and used on all other pages of your website.

Those two files are the JS API and the popup CSS rules that center the popup, dim the background, etc.

= Is Popups for Divi compatible with Caching plugins? =

Yes, absolutely! There is no dynamic logic in the PHP code like other popup plugins have. Popups for Divi is a little bit of PHP but the main logic sits inside the small javascript library it provides. It works on the client-side and therefore is not restricted by caching plugins.

= Is this plugin compatible with every Divi version? =

This plugin is kept compatible with the latest Divi release.

We did test it with all releases since the initial Divi 3.0 release. Possibly it will also work with older versions

= Does this plugin also work with other themes/site builders? =

Yes, actually it will! But out of the box it is optimized to work with Divi 3.x. If you use any other theme or site builder then you need to change the default options of the plugin via the `evr_divi_popup-js_data` filter.

For more details visit https://philippstracker.com/divi-popup/

= Does this plugin display any ads? =

No. This plugin is free and does not display any ads. In fact, the plugin does not have a UI at all.

Popups for Divi is just that - a plain popup plugin, not our marketing strategy!

Since version 1.6.0 we now offer a six-day email course that shows you how the plugin works. You will see a notification in your wp-admin dashboard right after activating the plugin. This is not an advertisement - you do not land in a newsletter list, but only receive those six onboarding mails.

= Do you collect any details from my website? =

No, we do not collect or transmit any data from your website.

Since version 1.6.0 there is one exception: We now offer an email course that shows you how the plugin works. You will see a notification in your wp-admin dashboard right after activating the plugin. When you opt-in to receive the onboarding emails we will transmit the details you entered (your name and email address) to the plugin website.

Those details are only used to send you the onboarding emails (6 emails) and for nothing else.

= Is there a way to hide the onboarding notice? =

Yes, there is!

Since 1.6.0 the plugin offers an onboarding course that consists of 6 emails. We offer this course right after plugin activation in your wp-admin "Dashboard" page (nowhere else).

This onboarding notice is displayed to administrator users only. Once the user clicks on the "Dismiss" button, the message is never displayed again for them.

You can also globally disable the onboarding notice by defining the constant [`DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices#Disable_Nag_Notices) in your wp-config.php or themes function.php

= I have more questions or need help =

Please first visit the [**plugin website**](https://philippstracker.com/divi-popup/), as it includes examples and documentation that could answer your questions.

If that does not help, then head over to the [**support forum**](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/popups-for-divi/) and post a new thread.

When you need additional features, then please have a look at our the Premium plugin [**Divi Areas Pro**](https://philippstracker.com/divi-areas-pro/) which comes with a lot of cool options!

We cannot provide customization and development via the forum. If you need that, [**you can hire us**](https://philippstracker.com/go/inquire-popup-change/) to create some special triggers, layouts or other changes.
